# Employees-success-rates_Prediction :necktie:
This project aims to develop a predictive model that assesses the likelihood of an employee successfully completing assigned tasks within the Human Resources (HR) department. HR plays a critical role in managing an organization's human capital and ensuring its profitability.

By considering factors such as employee experience and training level, the predictive model will assist HR professionals in making well-informed decisions about task assignments. Accurate task completion predictions will enable HR to optimize team assignments, leading to enhanced efficiency, productivity, and ultimately, the preservation of company benefits.

The model's insights will empower HR professionals to assign tasks based on employees' predicted success rates. By adopting a data-driven approach, HR can allocate resources effectively, ensure optimal task distribution, and maximize positive outcomes.

Overall, this project aims to support HR departments in refining their decision-making processes, streamlining task assignments, and contributing to the overall success and profitability of the organization.
